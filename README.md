# Artificial Life Simulator

An evolutionary feed-forward neural network to autonomously control an agent in an artificial life-based environment, which has the goal of surviving doing its own decisions rationally. The evolution of the neural network will be managed by a genetic algorithm that will be in charge of modifying the network weights.
